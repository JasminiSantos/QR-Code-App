## QR Code Generator
The QR Code Generator allows you to create a QR code for a given link. Simply enter the link and generate the QR code.

The QR Code Scanner feature enables you to scan QR codes using your device's camera. Upon scanning a QR code, the application will automatically redirect you to the corresponding link.
